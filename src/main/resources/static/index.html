            <p class="parrafoindex">Our eating habits largely determine the functioning of our body. A good diet adapted to our nutritional needs promotes health and prevents diseases.
                Healthy eating is about eating a variety of foods that give you the nutrients you need to stay healthy, feel good, and have energy. These nutrients include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, water, vitamins and minerals.
                A healthy diet must be varied, balanced, safe, adequate, complete and sufficient.</p>
            <ul class="lista">
                <li><strong>Complete:</strong> containing all the nutrients, include at least one food from each of the three groups in each meal.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced:</strong> that the nutrients are in appropriate proportions to each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Sufficient:</strong> that covers the needs of all nutrients, so that there is good nutrition and a healthy weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Varied:</strong> include different foods from each group in meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Safe:</strong> its regular consumption does not imply health risks and is consumed in moderation.</li>
                <li><strong>Adequate:</strong> that is in accordance with the tastes and culture of each person, adjusted to their economic resources without sacrificing other characteristics.</li>
